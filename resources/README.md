# Project resources

This **resources** folder contains essential data for the project, organized into two subfolders: **ref** (for reference genome) and  and **rep_regions**  (for repeated regions file).

## Reference Genome

The reference genome subfolder holds the reference genome files necessary for genomic analysis.

See **ref/README.md** for more information about how files were obtained.
